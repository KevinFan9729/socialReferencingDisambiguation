# Social Referencing Disambiguation
A computational framework that enables domestic service robots to disambiguate challenging situations with social referencing.

## Object fetching task in homes
Domestic service robots can encounter various ambiguities in home environments.
Some sources of ambiguity:
<ul>
  <li>Ambiguity due to low confidence in object detection</li>
  <li>Ambiguity caused by the detection of multiple potential targets</li>
  <li>Ambiguity sourced from the novelty of the target object</li>
</ul>
Service robots need to have a framework to disambiguate the reference with human signals and learn through interactions. This can help robots to become "lifelong" learners and be adaptive in tasks through experience and ad-hoc interaction.

## GUI
The robot can be commanded with either speech or keyboard input; the GUI will automatically display what the robot heard and provide a chance for the user to correct the label in the case of transcription issues.
